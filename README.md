# BikeBliss Frontend

The frontend for the BikeBliss application is built using React.js. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing bike and equipment rentals, designed to cater to both urban environments and hiking enthusiasts. Below are the main features and technologies used in the frontend:

## Key Features

- **User Interface:** A clean and responsive UI designed for seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Authentication:** Secure login and registration forms, integrated with JWT-based authentication for secure access to the platform.
- **Dashboard:** An intuitive dashboard where users can manage their rentals, view available bikes and equipment, and track the status of their reservations.
- **Rental Management:** Allows users to easily browse, select, and reserve bikes and equipment, with real-time availability checking.
- **Review System:** Enables users to leave feedback and reviews for the equipment and bikes they have rented, contributing to a community-driven rating system.
- **Admin Interface:** Provides administrators with tools to manage inventory, view user activity, and oversee rental operations.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** The core framework for building the user interface.
- **React Router:** For seamless navigation between different views and pages.
- **Axios:** For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **Redux:** State management to handle user data, authentication states, and rental operations.
- **Bootstrap:** For styling and responsive design components.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
